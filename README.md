# The Atomic Blog

The Atomic Blog is a simple blog application built with React, using context and state management to handle posts, a dark mode toggle, and a post archive feature. This project leverages the `faker` library to generate random posts and demonstrates common React patterns like context providers, hooks, and component composition.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle:** Allows users to switch between light and dark mode by toggling a CSS class on the HTML element.
- **Post Management:** Users can add new posts, search through posts, and clear all posts.
- **Post Archive:** A large archive of posts (generated using `faker`) that can be added to the main post list.
- **Responsive Layout:** The application is built with a responsive design.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-atomic-blog.git
   cd the-atomic-blog
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `App.js`: The main component of the application. It handles the dark mode toggle and provides the context for managing posts.
- `PostContext.js`: Provides the context for managing posts, including functions for adding and clearing posts.
- `Header.js`: Contains the header, search input, and a button to clear posts.
- `Main.js`: Contains the form for adding new posts and the list of posts.
- `Archive.js`: Displays an archive of randomly generated posts that can be added to the main post list.
- `Footer.js`: Contains the footer for the application.

## Usage

- **Toggle Dark Mode:** Click the button with the sun/moon icon to switch between light and dark mode.
- **Add a Post:** Fill in the title and body in the form and click "Add post".
- **Search Posts:** Type a query in the search input to filter posts by title or body.
- **Clear Posts:** Click the "Clear posts" button to remove all posts from the list.
- **View Archive:** Click the "Show archive posts" button to view a large list of archived posts. You can add any of these posts to the main post list by clicking "Add as new post".

## Performance Note

The `Archive` component generates a large list of posts (10,000 by default) to demonstrate performance considerations in React. You can reduce the number of generated posts by modifying the length of the array in the `Archive` component if the application becomes slow.
